# Zsh Config Usage

**Extend it (Easy)**
1. `git clone git@github.com:ampersandre/dotfiles.git`
2. Add `source ~/path/to/dotfiles/.zshrc` at the **top** of your own `~/.zshrc` file
3. Add your custom settings beneath that to suit your needs

Or 

**Just use it (Easier)**
1. Copy the contents of [`.zshrc`](https://github.com/ampersandre/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc) from this repo directly into your local `~/.zshrc`
